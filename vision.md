Aloha Cursor! 🌺 We are building the ultimate global social media platform and movement dedicated to empowering independent artists and creatives of every kind. This platform is a one-stop ecosystem that fuses self-expression, monetization, collaboration, and cultural preservation.


Please begin developing the initial architecture, UI/UX wireframes, and feature modules for the following artist-focused experience:

✨ Core Features to Build:
Artist Profiles: A rich digital portfolio with profile pic, bio, craft categories, location, media gallery, booking button, rates, and crowd-funding support

Photo & Video Posting: Artists should be able to share posts of their work, performances, behind-the-scenes, and more

Crowdfunding Support: A system like Patreon where fans can support artists directly

Rates & Booking System: Artists list rates and availability. Clients can book or collaborate through built-in request flow

🚀 Advanced Features:
Live Streaming & Virtual Events (open mics, live paint sessions, digital concerts, cooking tutorials)

Collaboration Matchmaker (AI pairs creatives with shared interests or complementary styles)

Digital Storefronts (sell art, beats, prints, merch, NFTs, and downloads directly)

Review & Reputation System (showcase feedback, testimonials, past projects)

Talent Discovery Engine (searchable directory by skill, location, genre, trending, etc.)

Grants & Competitions Module (sponsored contests with cash prizes and features)

Cultural Heritage Zones (dedicated spaces for ancestral art forms, Indigenous creators, and traditional knowledge sharing)

Offline-Friendly Mobile App (artists in low-connectivity areas can sync when online)

AI Creator Tools (caption generation, logo design, media editing, auto-contracts, style filters)

Artist Passport (digital resume + downloadable EPK with past works, ratings, awards, and more)

🌍 Vision Statement (for design inspiration):
"A global sanctuary where creativity rises, cultures thrive, and independent artists become unstoppable forces of change. This isn't just an app—it's a movement."

Begin by sketching the user journey from profile setup, media upload, and artist discovery, through to booking, payment, and collaboration.

Let's bring this to life with fire, purpose, and heart. The world is waiting for its artists to shine. 🌈🔥🎭🎶
